# Photohouse - HTML & CSS Website

# Introduction
This project is a Front End website for Photohouse, a marketing company based in London, England, that works with estate agents to provide photographs, floorplans and Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) on properties they are contracted to sell or let. The main purpose of the website is to raise brand awareness, promote quality of services offered and increase the number of potential new business leads for the company. Intended users are estate agents and homeowners so UX has been designed to create a feeling of professionalism and approachability with focus set on quality of services offered. 

The website uses HTML and CSS code only, and is interactive, provides constant feedback to the user, is based on UX experience design and is fully accessible and responsive down to 280px.

## User Experience

 ### User Stories

* As a website creator, I want to:
  
1. Build a website that is visually appealing from the userâ€™s first visit so they are intrigued to explore all the pages and contact the company for more details.
2. Build an easy to navigate website for its users.
   
* As a new visitor, I want to:

1. Understand the main purpose of the site.
2. Be able to easily navigate throughout the site and find relevant content about services provided.
3. Be able to easily contact the company for more information.
   
* As a returning visitor, I want to:

1. Review quality of services available
2. Obtain contact information and/or easily send a message to the company.
   
## Design

### Initial Concept - Wire Frames
* The vast majority of the initial design concept was followed with only a few alterations either due to an aspect not being required (e.g additional 'contact us' button on services page at bottom, map within footer) or to timely to install (e.g chatbox  on contact us page)<br>

### Typography
* The Anton, sans-serif is used for the company logo. Chosen for being bold and hard to miss.
* The Lato, sans-serif is used for section headings. Chosen for being ideal when used as a large font size without being overbearing.
* The Dancing Script, sans-serif is used to display either quotes or less important headings. Chosen for adding a sense of 'personal touch' thus cultivating a feeling of attention to detail, passion and approachability. 
* The Poppins, sans-serif is used as the main font for the whole website. Chosen for being easy to read.<br>

### Imagery
* Hero image chosen to convey quality, care and attention, warmth and modern styling. All qualities the company wishes to associate with. The image is also a good example of the quality of work the company can produce.
* 4 images are used in the Gallery Section of the Home Page to symbolise a style of photography, residential, lifestyle, twilight and drone. 
* 2 images are used in the Contact Us Section of the Home Page which are fixed in place whilst the user is scrolling. Images change at screen-width 800px to better suit the device. 
* All images converted to the webp files apart from those in the readme.md file.

### Google Maps
* The web site has a Google Maps location section where the users can locate the office in London.

### Interactive Links  

* At the bottom of each page inside the Footer Section and again on the Contact Us Page, users can access the company social media links. Once these icons are clicked they are opened in a new tab. 
* In the Footer Section and Contact Us Page, users can click on the company email address to send an email. 


## Existing Features

### Landing Page 

* The Landing Page is the first contact that users have with the website. A large hero image covers the user's screen and acts as a hook to intrigue the user to explore the site whilst already having an installed perception of quality. 
* It also features text used to deliver a marketing slogan to retain the users engagement and quickly provide context of what the company offers.<br>

### Services Section

### Contact Us Section 

* The contact us section on the home page is located after the services section as a call to action after reviewing an overview of services provided.
* A user may be on the verge of wanting to make contact with the company after reviewing the services so the positioning of the call to action is intentional.
* Having multiple calls to action for contacting the company is important in order to reach the website's goal of generating more enquiries.

### Functional Testing 
* All links have been hovered and clicked to ensure accessibility, and all are working correctly.
* All images have alt attributes
* All links have ariel-labels
* Pages all load correctly on all device screen sizes.
* All social media links work correctly and open on a new tab.
* All images load on each page as intended.
* All navigation links are working correctly and bring the users to the function intended.
* The form on the contact us page was tested to ensure it functioned as expected. Data is required within all sections of the form or submition isn't possible. Thank you page was displayed as expected once the form had been filled out correctly and submitted.

### Bugs

* Navigation links to particular sections of a webpage were loading out of alignment. This was fixed by using 'scroll-margin' and adjusting the height of the navbar.
* iPhone 4 screen height was found to be shorter than the nav menu meaning part of the nav menu was unreachable. This was fixed by implementing a specific media query for screen heights less than 590px.
* On the Home Page, sections would overlap each other when testing responsiveness. This was fixed by setting About Section, Services Section and Gallery Section to 'max-height: 100%;'
* On the Services Page, float was used for initial layout however issues arose with responsiveness testing. This was fixed by rebuilding the page based on grid layout. 
* No further bugs found to be present on the website.
